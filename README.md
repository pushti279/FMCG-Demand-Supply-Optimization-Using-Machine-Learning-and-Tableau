# FMCG-Demand-Supply-Optimization-Using-Machine-Learning-and-Tableau
Data analysis and predictive modeling project for an FMCG company to optimize shipment weights across warehouses using Python (EDA + ML), Tableau (dashboards), and KNIME (workflow automation)


This project focuses on optimizing supply and distribution for an FMCG (Fast-Moving Consumer Goods) company that recently entered the instant noodles business.
The company faced demand–supply mismatches — overstocking in low-demand areas and shortages in high-demand ones.

The goal is to use historical data and machine learning to:

Predict optimum shipment weight (tons) for each warehouse.

Identify regional demand patterns.

Create interactive dashboards for management and stakeholders.
